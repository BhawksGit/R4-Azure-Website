    <h2>Q: What is R4 Azure?</h2>
    <p>A: It's an R4 that utilizes its own version of the Ace3DS+ kernel with U.S. based software support.</p>
    <h2>Q: How do I use it?</h2>
    <p>A: Simply drag and drop the ROMs you download into their designated folder on the microSD card. For instance, if
      it's an NDS ROM, you will drag the ROM into the "/NDS ROMS" folder.</p>
    <h2>Q: Where can I get ROMs for this R4?</h2>
    <p>A: There are plenty of websites that host ROMs that you may download. A simple google search for the name of the
      ROM followed by "nds rom" should give you results.</p>
    <h2>Q: Does this have a timebomb?</h2>
    <p>A: No. Unlike many other competitors, R4 Azure does not contain a timebomb, meaning that it will not limit its
      functionality on a certain date to get you to buy a new one.</p>
